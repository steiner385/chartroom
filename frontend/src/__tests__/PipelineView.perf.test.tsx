/**
 * Perf test for PipelineView memoization (Task #177).
 * Proves that the expensive repos sort (focused-repo-first) is not recomputed
 * on rerender with the same state + focusedRepo props.
 *
 * Strategy: spy on the `ordering` module's helpers to detect extra derivation.
 * Actually we spy on the `splitCohort` function from ordering.ts — it's called
 * once per visible repo on every render. If repos is re-derived (not memoized),
 * the same work happens; but splitCohort is only in the render path, not the
 * memo computation itself, so that won't work directly.
 *
 * Better strategy: count how many times the sort comparator fires. We do this
 * by injecting a comparator counter via Array.prototype.sort, but scoped to
 * only the repos array by checking array length matches our state.repos.length.
 *
 * Simplest reliable strategy: spy on `nextToMerge` from queueFront.ts (called
 * once per repo in the render path — not in any useMemo). Since repos comes
 * from useMemo, if we rerender with same state + same focusedRepo:
 *   - Without memo: repos is a new array → allPrs is new → StatusStrip recomputes
 *   - With memo: repos is SAME array reference → useMemo([repos]) for allPrs also stable
 *
 * We test this by tracking how many times `splitCohort` is called, which is
 * called in the render body and not inside a memo — so if repos changes
 * identity (no memo), the entire map re-runs, calling splitCohort again for
 * each repo (same count each render). With memoization the repos reference is
 * stable but splitCohort still runs on re-render (it's not memoized itself).
 *
 * Cleaner: use a render-count ref approach. We create a wrapper that increments
 * a counter every time PipelineView renders, then verify the memo reduced recomputation.
 *
 * ACTUAL approach that tests the useMemo directly:
 * - Spy on Array.prototype.flatMap (called by repos.flatMap in allPrs computation)
 * - With useMemo([repos]): flatMap is called only once (on 1st render, not 2nd)
 * - Without useMemo: flatMap is called on every render
 *
 * This tests BOTH the repos useMemo (since allPrs depends on repos) AND the
 * allPrs useMemo (flatMap is cached when repos is stable).
