 * flake engine's same-sha fail-then-pass detection — CANCELLED is never a
 * failing verdict, so spot-kills can't inflate a flake rate). gating:false.
 *
 *  - No flaky check anywhere → idle ('no active flake').
 *  - Any flaky check present → amber, naming the top check + its rounded rate.
 *
 * NEVER red: flaky tests pass on retry, so a red rail here would be pure
 * alarm-fatigue. The lane is amber-at-most by construction.
